      <h2><strong>Why we chose to do our project on <em>IoT</em> </strong> </h2>
      <p>We chose to make a user-friendly website about IoT because of the realisation that it plays a big role in our lives. For example, how transport and medicine has advanced over time. We went from having steam trains to have electro-magnetic trains. How people died from the common cold to having monthly flu-shot vaccines ready at your nearest clinic.   </p>

      <h3><em>The importance of <strong>IoT</strong></em></h3>
      <p> IoT has helped us evolve as humans and to get things done faster and more efficiently. IoT (the Internet of Things) starts from the celullar devices we use to the airplanes and robots that were featured in <em>RoboCop</em>.</p>
      <p>Iot has helped so many people but people dont know about its full capabilities. Iot has helped us evolve our lives into the advanced lifestyles that we live. From mass farming, to the advancement of medicine. There are many sectors of IoT and so much information tha you can explore. IoT is the study of the internet and how it is intertwinedwith our everyday devices. IoT is a network of devices and the internet without human interruption, for the benefit of people.  </p>
